1. 특정 네임스페이스의 팟 개수 조회
k get po -n default

2. 특정 네임스페이스의 레플리카셋 개수 조회
k get rs -n default

3. How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?


4. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

5. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
```bash
kubectl describe rs/new-replica-set
```

6. how many ?? replicasset ready?

7. Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

8. Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

9. Delete any one of the 4 PODs.

10. why do you think the pods number still same like just like before you delete?

11. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.
There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.

12. Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.

This file is located at /root/.
- wrong
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

- correct 
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
  labels:
    app: frontend
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

13. Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.

Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

핵심은 팟을 새롭게 구성해야함. 설정 값들이 새로 적용하기 위해서

14. 
$ kubectl create replicaset new --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > firstdeploy.yaml
